# Ceramic Developer Local Sandbox

Complete the Ceramic Developer onboarding by verifying your own profile and others! This repository is organized as an extension of the [ComposeDB Sandbox](https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/sandbox), so it is recommended that you complete the instruction on that page first.

## How does this Application Work?

This Sandbox Extension application uses the same Ceramic node endpoint as the [ComposeDB Sandbox](https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/sandbox), as well as an extended [runtime definition](./src/__generated__/definition.js) that allows developers to verify their developer profiles, as well as others.

## Getting Started

1. Install your dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the application in development

```bash
npm run dev
```
